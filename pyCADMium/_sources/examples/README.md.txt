Grid.ipynb

- Creates a basic grid by specifying the number of points. Each grid depends on the number of radial/angular points that is multiplied by the number of points per block. 

- Naturally, with a greater number of points, the calculation is more accurate and expensive. 

- Here, we do an example with the Boron atom. Additionally, we include a 2D plot to see how the points are distributed in space. 

- Lastly, we create a 3D plot showing the convergence of the energy with respect to the number of points.
