**Inverting A Density**
=======================

Here we present all the availiable methods in *n2v*. The following methods focus 
on the inverse Kohn-Sham problem. That is, for a given target density -- and for 
some cases the orbitals and energies -- find the exchange-correlation potential that generates 
*that* density. 

Click on each of the individual methods to find more about them.
